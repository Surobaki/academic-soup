I've always wanted to get into open source code beacause it just seems cool to be able to contribute to a global body of work that's free in terms of access and rights. I've been working on [my group bill sharing app](https://academic-soup.web.app/projects/grofi.html) in [IHP](https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/) and as part of that I've been doing a lot of research into how IHP works over at the [digitally induced](https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/Slack) Slack. After solving some technical issues, I ended up being offered to write additional documentation so people who are doing similar troubleshooting can find their way around easily. The contribution was only a paragraph in a massive list of troubleshooting options, but I've never felt as satisfied as when opening [that pull request](https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp/pull/1491).
