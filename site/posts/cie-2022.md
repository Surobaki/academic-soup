A few weeks back I got the chance to attend (and help organise) the wonderful [Computability in Europe](https://www.acie.eu/cie-conference-series/) conference at Swansea University! I had a great time learning about the frontier of computability theory and met some amazing people who motivated me to pursue more abstract mathematics within computer science.

I attended interesting talks on constructive mathematics, bioinformatics, homeotopy type theory (talk by *[Thierry Coquand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thierry_Coquand)* that I'd like to get to writing a report on eventually) and even some blockchain technologies. I listened to fascinating perspectives on the history of computation by *[Liesbeth de Mol](https://pro.univ-lille.fr/liesbeth-de-mol/)* and had a great time at the excursion to the Worm's Head in the Gower.

I should have photos soon...
