# Academic Soup
Academic Soup is the name of my personal website. It's built from a template using [Slick](https://github.com/ChrisPenner/slick). It's deployed on [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). I'm trying to stick to my personal coding and design philosophies to showcase the way I like things most:
* minimal large frameworks for small projects,
* playful design,
* not taking the project (or yourself) too seriously.

# Roadmap
_Last update: \[2022-07-25\]_
* [x] Start playing around with my tech stack
* [x] Create an acceptable design prototype in HTML/CSS
* [ ] Finish creation of HTML/CSS/JS frontend with [Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/) templating

* [ ] Set up functional blogging with Slick

# FAQ
_Question 1._
> Why Firebase?

I just don't have much experience with other things and Firebase seems simple to set up.

_Question 2._
> Why Haskell/Slick?

I'm going through a phase of interest and hyperfixation on [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/). Slick came up first in my searches and it seemed to match my desire for simplicity and speed.
